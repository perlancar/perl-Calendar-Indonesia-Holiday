0.23     2014-08-16  Released-By: SHARYANTO; Note: Happy 19th CPAN Day!

         - [build] CLI scripts are now generated automatically using
           Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ScriptFromFunc. The plugin is still at 0.01 so the
           generated script is not as polished as it should be. Stay tuned.


0.22     2014-08-06  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Update data: 2015 holidays (official, decreed May 7th, so I'm a bit
           late).


0.21     2014-07-02  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - No functional changes.

         - [Bugfix] scripts/ or bin/ files need to have something like #!perl and
           not #!/usr/bin/env perl so it can be replaced to the path of perl when
           installing [RT#96884]

         - Change wording of Pemilu -> Pemilu Legislatif, Pilpres -> Pemilu
           Presiden.


0.17     2014-04-08  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Rename fields 'id_aliases' -> 'ind_aliases' and 'en_aliases' ->
           'eng_aliases' to be more consistent (language codes in field/function
           names use ISO 3-letter codes while country names use ISO 2-letter
           codes).

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add tentative holiday: Pilpres 2014.

         - Add holidays: Pemilu 2009, Pilpres 2009.

         - Add note field (currently unused).

         - Add year and month to positional arguments so you can just say
           'list-id-holidays 2014' or 'list-id-holidays 2014 4' instead of
           'list-id-holidays --year 2014 --month 4'. This is a bit like the Unix
           'cal' command, except that the order of arguments is (year) or
           (year,month) instead of (year) or (month,year).


0.16     2014-04-08  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Add holiday: Pemilu 2014.

         - Add decree_date and decree_note fields when data is available (only
           for a couple of holidays so far).


0.15     2013-12-12  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - No functional changes.

         [REMOVED FEATURES]

         - Remove alias module Calendar::Indonesia::Holiday. I'm in general no
           longer in favor of alias modules, except when it's really needed
           (e.g. original name is really long).


0.14     2013-08-27  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Update data: 2014 holidays (official, decreed Aug 21st).


0.13     2013-07-25  Released-By: SHARYANTO

0.09     2012-06-04  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - No functional changes. Update to Perinci::Sub::Gen::AccessTable 0.11.


0.08     2012-03-22  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - No functional changes. Update to Perinci::Sub::Gen::AccessTable 0.08.


0.07     2011-12-14  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - No functionality changes.

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Column 'id_name' becomes 'ind_name', 'en_name' becomes 'eng_name'.
           Sorry. The use of 'id' for 'Indonesian' is easily confused with
           'identifier'.


0.06     2011-12-14  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - No library changes. Add command-line script.


0.05     2011-10-05  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - Fix some calendar mistakes, add holidays from 2002-2007.


0.04     2011-07-19  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - enum_id_workdays() (and count_id_workdays()) now accepts 'start_date'
           and 'end_date' arguments instead of 'year'/'mon', to be more flexible
           (list_id_holidays() should probably do too, but this requires
           enhancements to Sub::Spec::Gen::ReadTable first).

         [FIXES]

         - Calendar::ID::Holiday alias module previously couldn't export
           functions.


0.03     2011-07-10  Released-By: SHARYANTO
